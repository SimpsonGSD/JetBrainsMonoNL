# JetBrains Mono NL (no ligatures).

# UPDATE: As of v1.4 JetBrains now provides the offical NL versions https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono/releases/tag/v1.0.4

This is a version of JetBrains Mono font that has been modified to remove ligatures. This is for those that do not like or are not used to seeing ligatures but enjoy using JetBrains Mono. A lot of programs do not provide a way to disable ligatures meaning this is the only way to use JetBrains Mono without them. Hopefully JetBrains can provide both versions in the future.

Compared to the original font this font may be, broken, incomplete, buggy or wrong. I do not provide any guarantee that this modified font is without issues.
