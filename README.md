# JetBrains Mono NL (no ligatures).
This is a modified version of JetBrains Mono font without ligatures for those that do not like or are not used to ligatures. A lof of programs do not provide a way to disable ligatures meaning this is the only way to use this font without it. Hopefully JetBrains can provide both versions in the future.

Original font https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/

Compared to the original font this font may be, broken, incomplete, buggy or wrong. I do not provide any guarantee that this modified font is without issues.
